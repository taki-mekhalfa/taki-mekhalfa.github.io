Hello my name is Taki! A software engineer with a profound quest for Existential Understanding. I Hate complexity and am obsessed with the fascinating intricacies of software engineering challenges.

**Golang**, **Rust**, and **Pytho**n are my trusted companions, each with its own quirks and powers waiting to be harnessed.

In my freetime I enjoy spending time with my *Nouss*, delve into the abyss of the existential melancholy with *Ghiles* and watch huge machinery videos.
